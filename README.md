Jekyll project to fullfil three personal objectives: 
  1. Have a personal webpage.
  2. Playing with Jekyll for the first time. 
  3. Setting up my first Digital Ocean Droplet. 

This project will grow and the stack might change over time but as of now (20200101) this is a project to try new technologies and awaken some sleepy skills.
